# E-commerce_Linear_Regression_Project
You just got some contract work with an E-commerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come into the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.  The company is trying to decide whether to focus its efforts on its mobile app experience or its website. They've hired you on contract to help them figure it out!   (it's fake, don't worry, this isn't a real credit card number or email).
